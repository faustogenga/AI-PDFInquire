At first his solo \ncareer didn't take off, b ut he did have a few hit songs including \" Ben\" and \" Got to Be There .\" \nHowever, in 1978 Michael met music producer Quincy Jones while working on the set of the \nmovie The Wiz . He broke away from the family band and worked on his first \"grown up\" \nalbum. In 19 79, Michael released the album Off the Wall . It was a huge hit and had four top \nten songs including the number one singles \" Rock with You \" and \" Don't Stop 'til You Get \nEnough .\" Michael was now one of the biggest stars in music.  \n \nThriller   \n \nMichael wanted to follow up Off the Wall  with an even bigger album. This was going to be \nquite the task. He worked with Quincy Jones again and in late 1982 released the album \nThriller . The album was a huge success. It had seven top ten singles and won eight Grammy \nawards. Eventually, Thriller  would become the best selling album of all time. Michael had \nnow become the biggest star in the music industry.  \n \nIn addition to the music on Thriller, Michael also broke new ground with his music videos. \nUp until that time, most music videos just showed the band or singer performing the song. \nMichael wanted to create a story with his videos. These new types of music videos became \nvery popular and changed the way music videos were made. The most famous of his videos \nwas a 13 minute long video for the album's title song Thriller . It was later voted as the most \ninfluential music video of all time.  \n \nLater Career   \n \nAlthough Michael's career peaked with  the Thriller  album, he released several more \nsuccessful albums including Bad (1987), Dangerous  (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and \nFuture, Book I  (1995), and Invincible  (2001).  \n \nPrivate Life   \n \nMichael Jackson led an interesting, if somewhat strange, priva te life.

His first marriage was to Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of the \nfamous rock singer Elvis Presley . His second marriag e was to a nursing assistant named \nDebbie Rowe. He had two children, Michael Joseph Jackson and Paris -Michael Katherine \nJackson, with Debbie before they were divorced. Michael also had a third child, Prince \nMichael Jackson II, but the mother's identity is unknown.  \n \nChanging Appearance   \n \nMichael was also famous for changing his appearance. Over the years his nose became \nthinner, his face changed shape, and his skin tone became lighter. Some people think that he \ndid not like his appearance because of his abu se from his father at a young age. There is also \nsome debate as to how his skin tone changed.
